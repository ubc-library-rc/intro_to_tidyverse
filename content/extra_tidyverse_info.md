## Joining tables (join dataframes)
<p>Joining table is an important part of data analysis, because data tend to be in seperate files. There is an <a href="https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/relational-data-r/" target="_blank">existing workshop</a> you can work through. Joins are part of the <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/index.html" target="_blank">dplyr package</a>. </p>
<p><em>tip:</em> When joining tables (dataframes), it is very important to look at what variables are being joined (visible in the console section) and to look at if the number of rows and columns in the joined dataframe matches your expectations.</p>
