# Take home messages

1.  tidyverse is a package that helps you load many other packages (for data manipulation) into R at once

2.  Data manipulation is important to format data for analysis and visualization

3.  To figure out what tidyverse commands to use, search for what you want to do + in R using plain language and you can probably find the answer pretty quickly.
