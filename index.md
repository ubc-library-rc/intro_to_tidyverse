## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to: 
1. Know what tidyverse is.
2. Understand the uses of data manipulation packages.
3. Have an idea of where to start looking for answers when manipulating your data.

## What are we not learning today?

It is impossible to go through all packages in detail. We are providing only a small snippet of what each package in the tidyverse can do and we are leaving some packages out of this workshop entirely.
